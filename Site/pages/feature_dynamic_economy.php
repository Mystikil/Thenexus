                <p>The economy tracks supply and demand across regions. Monster drops, gathering nodes, and crafting orders all feed real metrics that adjust vendor prices and auction tax rates. When miners flood the exchange with ore, smelters get cheaper inputs but refined bars trend downward until demand catches up.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">Seasonal events and faction initiatives introduce temporary bonuses that can swing profitability. Pay attention to world announcements and bulletin boards for hints on upcoming surpluses or shortages.</p>

                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Track regional trends:</strong> The commerce UI highlights hot and cold items. Buying low in one territory and hauling to another with higher demand nets caravan bonuses.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2"><strong>Leverage crafting commissions:</strong> Players post custom orders with rush fees. Fulfill them quickly to earn loyalty and unlock preferred-bid status.</li>
                    <li class="mb-0"><strong>Stabilize communities:</strong> Towns with sustained shortages unlock civic quests that grant tax rebates and unique crafting motifs to participants.</li>

                <p class="mb-0">Price caps prevent market crashes, while weekly audits flag suspicious trades. Transparent history keeps flipping fairâ€”if someone corners a market, the system triggers NPC buy orders to restore balance. You always know the true value of your haul before you list it.</p>
