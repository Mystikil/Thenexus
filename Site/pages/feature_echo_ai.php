                <h3 class="h5 mb-3">How to play around it</h3>
                <p>E.C.H.O rewards preparation and adaptability. Scout opponents, bring consumables that complement your build, and swap tactics mid-fight. Parties that diversify roles—controllers, disruptors, healers—unlock special team maneuvers when the AI flags optimal openings.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">If the system marks you as a consistent victor in an area, it will escalate to elite variants with improved loot tables. Struggling groups get subtle assists such as longer telegraphs or ally patrols. Lean into these signals to keep momentum.</p>
