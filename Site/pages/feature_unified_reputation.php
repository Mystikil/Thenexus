                <h3 class="h5 mb-3">One reputation, many doors</h3>
                <p>Every quest, trade, and social action feeds a unified score. Earn favor through clean trades, faction contracts, or rescuing caravans; lose it by defaulting on orders or attacking allied territory. The higher you climb, the more privileged services unlock across the entire world.</p>
                <ul class="mb-0">
                    <li class="mb-2">Gain <strong>preferred trader</strong> status to access exclusive stock rotations and lower marketplace fees.</li>
                    <li class="mb-2">Unlock cross-faction fast travel routes and safehouse storage shared across your account.</li>
                    <li class="mb-0">Maintain elite reputation to earn cosmetic heraldry that broadcasts your standing to other players.</li>

                <h3 class="h5 mb-3">Keeping score transparent</h3>
                <p>Your reputation UI breaks down weekly gains and losses so you always know what influenced your standing. Milestone alerts signal when you are close to the next tier, and advisors offer personal tasks to close the gap.</p>
                <p class="mb-0">Negative actions trigger grace periods rather than immediate lockouts. Fix the issue quickly—repay debts, return stolen goods, or complete restitution quests—and you can avoid major penalties.</p>

                <p class="mb-0">Vendors reference your reputation when calculating bulk order limits, caravan insurance, and contract payouts. High-standing players earn dividend chests from regional trade profits, while low-standing players see higher taxes and fewer buy orders. Your choices shape both your wallet and how the world responds.</p>
